I'm attempting to get the compute to randomly generate numbers, which simulates a card game.

Blackjack involves a full deck of 52 cards.

I want to player to draw two randomly generated cards. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their value in points. Face cards are worth 10 points. Aces can be worth 1 or 10 points.
